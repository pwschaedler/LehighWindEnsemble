        John began piping in 1984 at the age of twelve with the Essex Shillelagh Pipes and Drums of New Jersey. In 1986 he began his first year of what is now fifteen years of privite instruction under Pipe Major George M. Bell.<br><br>
        P/M George M. Bell, a World Champion Piper, is regarded as one of the fathers of piping in America.<br><br>
        John began teaching the bagpipe while attending college in New Jersey. As the number of his students grew, so did his love for teaching. By 1997, John was teaching full time.<br><br>
        In 1998 John helped form the Passaic County Emerald Society Pipe Band as their head instructor. He also founded and instructed the New Jersey Pipe Band Academy, a weekly workshop designed to ease beginner pipers through the sometimes awkward jump to pipe band performing. In the Fall of 1998, John moved to New York City and began teaching out of his Manhattan studio.<br><br>
        Today, John is a full time member of the New York based Celtic rock band Gael Force. John's piping as well as his backup vocals are featured on the latest Gael Force CD which is due out September 2000. John is also working on a solo CD which is due out St. Patrick's Day 2001. He also acts as a consultant to the Passaic County Emerld Society Pipe Band, now one of the largest Police and Fire bands in the state of New Jersey. But, most imporatly, John Bradley is the private instructor to those who enjoy playing the joyful, and yet sometimes hauntingly sad music, of one of the oldest musical instruments known to mankind... the Bagpipe.
