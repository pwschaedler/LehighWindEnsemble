        The Wind Ensemble at Lehigh University is a select group of students dedicated to the performance of original music written for woodwinds, brass and percussion. Drawn from various colleges of the University, these students represent many diverse majors including engineering (civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical), computer science, physics, biology and business, as well as many fields of the liberal arts. Under Mr. Digg's direction, the Wind Ensemble was honored by Downbeat magazine, receiving the award for the most outstanding college symphonic band in its 22nd Annual Student Music Awards.
